### Personal Statement
As a research scientist, I am passionate about developing sustainable solutions for open challenges in future multi-domain complex systems. Throughout this journey, I keep challenging myself with an open mind and exploring many new domains to broaden my limited understanding.

I am currently working on the following research topics:

### 1. Distributed and Democratized Learning

I and my team are enthusiastic about the future of personalized services using distributed AI platforms. The complex hierarchical of social structure inspires us to move towards a novel distributed learning paradigm, namely *Democratized Learning* (**Dem-AI**). We envision Dem-AI to play an important role in this journey and step by step to bring Dem-AI systems from the philosophy to the practical implementation. Through our studies, we aim to profoundly analyze and better control the vital generalization and specialization capability of the learning models in the Dem-AI systems.
  * Our first paper about Dem-AI philosophy was accepted in *IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine*. [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301)
  * Currently we are working on the initial implementation of Dem-AI that is available on [Github](https://github.com/nhatminh/Dem-AI) and submitted to a conference.
  * Dem-AI works were presented in an invited talk at The International Workshop on Distributed Cloud Computing (DCC) co-located with ACM SIGMETRICS 2020. [Link](http://dcc2020.ec.tuwien.ac.at/#meet-team)
  * The second paper with the title "Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" was published on *IEEE Internet of Things Journal* in 2021.
  
### 2. Federated Learning
I collaborate in several Federated Learning papers that were published on ([INFOCOM 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8737464/)) and the other papers are under review.
  * My paper about Federated Learning with the title "Toward Multiple Federated Learning Services Resource Sharing in Mobile Edge Networks" was published to *IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing*
  * The ACM/IEEE Transactions on Networking journal version of INFOCOM paper "Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: Convergence Analysis and Resource Allocation" was published in *IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking*. [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13067)
  * I am also the co-author of the published Federated Learning papers in *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications* and *IEEE Communications Magazine*.


### 3. Colocation Base Stations and Edge Computing
I studied the resource sharing model for colocation services such as colocation mobile Base Stations and edge computing during my Ph.D. thesis. Accordingly, we published a proposal for the *Fair Sharing of Backup Power* on *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications* ([IEEE TWC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9050517)) and another proposal for *Colocation Edge Computing*  on *IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology* ([IEEE TVT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8247284)).
