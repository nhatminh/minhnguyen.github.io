### Personal Statement
As a research scientist, I am passionate about developing sustainable solutions for open challenges in future complex systems. Throughout this journey, I keep challenging myself with an open mind and exploring many new domains to broaden my limited understanding.

I currently working on the following research topics

### 1. Distributed and Democratized Learning

I and my team are enthusiastic about the future of personalized services using distributed AI platforms. The complex hierarchical of social structure inspires us to move towards a novel distributed learning paradigm, namely *Democratized Learning* (**Dem-AI**). We step by step to bring Dem-AI systems from the philosophy to the practical implementation. Throughout our studies, we profoundly analyze and better control the important generalization and specialization capability of the learning models in the Dem-AI systems.
  * Our first paper about Dem-AI philosophy can be found on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301)
  * Currently we are working on the initial implementation of Dem-AI that is available on [Github](https://github.com/nhatminh/Dem-AI)
  
### 2. Federated Learning
I collobrate in severals Federated Learning papers that was published on ([INFOCOM 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8737464/)) and the other papers are under review.
  * My paper about Federeated Learning with the tittle "Toward Multiple Federated Learning Services Resource Sharing in Mobile Edge Networks" was submitted to *IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing* (**Major Revision**)
  * The journal version of INFOCOM paper "Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: Convergence Analysis and Resource Allocation" was submitted to *IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking* (**Major Revision**). [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13067)


### 3. Colocation Base Stations and Edge Computing
I studied the resource sharing model for colocation services such as colocation mobile Base Stations and edge computing during my PhD thesis. Accordingly, we published a proposal for the *Fair Sharing of Backup Power* on *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications* ([IEEE TWC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9050517)) and another proposal for *Colocation Edge Computing*  on *IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology* ([IEEE TVT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8247284)).
