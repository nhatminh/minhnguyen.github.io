This is Dr. Nguyen Account's home on the web!
I currently working on the following research topics

### 1. Distributed and Democratized Learning

I and my team are enthusiastic about the future of personalized services by the distributed AI platform. The complex hierarchical of social structure inspires us to move towards a novel distributed learning paradigm, namely *democratized learning* (**Dem-AI**). We step by step to bring Dem-AI systems from the philosophy to the practical implementation. Throughout our studies, we profoundly analyze and better control the important generalization and specialization capability of the learning models in the Dem-AI systems.
  * Our first paper about Dem-AI philosophy can be found on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301).


### 2. Colocation BS and Edge Computing
I worked on this resource sharing model for colocation services such as colocation BSs and edge computing during my PhD thesis. Accordingly, we published a proposal for the *fair sharing of backup power* on IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications (IEEE TWC) and another *colocation edge computing*  on IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (IEEE TVT).
