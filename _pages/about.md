I currently working on the following research topics

### 1. Distributed and Democratized Learning

I and my team are enthusiastic about the future of personalized services by the distributed AI platform. The complex hierarchical of social structure inspires us to move towards a novel distributed learning paradigm, namely *democratized learning* (**Dem-AI**). We step by step to bring Dem-AI systems from the philosophy to the practical implementation. Throughout our studies, we profoundly analyze and better control the important generalization and specialization capability of the learning models in the Dem-AI systems.
  * Our first paper about Dem-AI philosophy can be found on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301)
  * Currently we are working on the initial implementation of Dem-AI [Code](https://github.com/nhatminh/Dem-AI)
  
### 2. Federated Learning
I collobrate in severals Federated Learning papers that was published on ([INFOCOM 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8737464/)) and under review manuscripts.


### 3. Colocation BS and Edge Computing
I worked on this resource sharing model for colocation services such as colocation BSs and edge computing during my PhD thesis. Accordingly, we published a proposal for the *fair sharing of backup power* on IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications ([IEEE TWC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9050517)) and another *colocation edge computing*  on IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology ([IEEE TVT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8247284)).
