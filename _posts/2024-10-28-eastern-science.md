### Adventure to Western Science
Since I was young and working towards PhD program, understanding powerful scientific approaches such as theoretical analysis, experimental analysis helps me a lot to catch up my research domains. Year by year working hard by analyzing the concepts, equations, derviation in paper based on many approximation to relax or prove for the solution approach. This journey amazes me at the first sight of understanding deeper about complex systems. 
  * As the powerful tools for science, this deviate us from bias and magically resolve many difficult research problems
  * I start applying theories to the research to get good publication according to normal high-quality research standards

Soon, I realized the big gap between my research and the daily reality and starting wonder about the meaning and practical senses. I am start looking for stronger theory, extend the research problem to bring it to more complicated scenarios but still a tremendous gap still there. But as usual publication race is more important to figure out the actual cause of things, this is not because of we are lazy but it is somehow relate to limitation of our approach as well. (I would not describe further, since my limited experience and capability could not represent others).

### Adventure to explore different views of life
But from my inner understanding, I would love to find other ways to see things differently or deeper...
I bought semi-pro and pro camreas and lenses to see how enthusiastic photographer see things and after years I see the beauty in even grass and light. That journey takes me closer to art meaning even I don't exactly know how to explain it. Beauty is sometimes actually nonsense to my logical mindset.
I continue for a while with guitar and learn some experience of melodies. Here I feel the beauty is also in melody, which is also nonsense to my logical mindset. 
It seems I started living with two different views of life sense beauty (maths, equations) as well as nonsense beauty (light, melody)

The best lesson I learnt so far that things can be viewed and experienced by sense as well as nonsense
An artistic scientist enables me to start viewing things with a more open mindset 

This journey finally comes with a new idea for the philosophy of democratized learning (sense-nonsense reasons). 
I extended my journey to philosophy and look for analogy physic, biology, chemistry patterns to explore what actually system behaviors of distributed AIs.
I learnt there we have complex biological world, the complex chemistrical reactions and physical laws. Go deep, it is not difficult to see many magical intteligent pathology, chains, patterns. 
And the links are blurred... 
(Again. I would not describe further, since my limited experience and capability could not represent others).

### Another leap coming
It finally lead me to whole new areas that nowadays science often leave behind such as accient knowledge and philosophy. This leap take me a long journey to learn and glimpse on how accients view of life.
I wish I would not touch many constroversial things but instead this let me question more broadly about the nature of existing and life, the nature of things. Surprisingly, How simple and deep they are...

Especially in Eastern philosophies, they don't need equations or experiments to cure people, how they can do that?
How difference they defined and interactd with the nature?
How difference approaches they used?
Most of them are magically nonsense to nowadays science?

### Eastern Approach
At first, I hardly to see things in Eastern way according to nowadays Western science. Seems, a lot of beliefs and unexplained results are available the public and could be nonsense totally.
But in Eastern approaches, it seems we need great master to help us understand the deep mechanism behind the seen. Seems unseen, unawared mechanisms affect strongly many seen mechanisms.
The Eastern approaches seems accept heuristic approaches lead to practical results rather than proving by equations. 

Eastern approaches ask us to be living deeply based on the humanity ethics, unselfish, goodness, widsom based on casual effects. Remind us to respect nature, ecosystems, harmony being, sharing community, totality, unification, peace.
(Again. I would not describe further, since my limited experience and capability could not represent others).

### Eastern Science
Last but not least, this final part is the main motivation for this blog.
I am here in USA, looking at the great success of AI. Many big plans for applying AI into normal lives also raise a lot of visible/invisible concerns. 
I wonder Western science is left behind the fast-growing Large AIs towards the big things like AGI (artificial general intelligence). 
Theoretical science tried all of their efforts but could not catch the big AIs.
Indeed, technologies often come with pros and cons. If we keep the old fashions try to prove things after its widely usage, science seems be left behind. So, it will be ineffective responsibility for the emerging powerful technologies such as AI. 
A question came to me? Can we prove everything regarding highly-dynamic and fast-ever evolved intelligence?
If we not go deeper to the nature/roots of problems itself, we hardly to see the big picture as a whole.

A new approach may emerge as my current vision:
- A thing could be seen in many views, angles but can be understandable when we concentrate more towards the roots not only the top
- Accept the nonsense since we don't know what we don't know due to our limited senses and perspectives
- A lot of problems cannot be proved by maths equations but we live with it and adapt to the frequent changes (E.g.: our balance body, earth ecosystem, social welfare and peace)
