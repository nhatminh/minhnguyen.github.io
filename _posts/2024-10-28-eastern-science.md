### Adventure to Western Science
Since I was young and working towards PhD program, understanding powerful scientific approaches such as theoretical analysis, and experimental analysis has helped me a lot to catch up with my research domains. Year by year work hard by analyzing the concepts, equations, and derivations in paper based on many approximations to relax, add more assumptions reduce complexity, or prove the efficiency of the solution approach. This journey amazes me at the first sight of understanding deeper about complex systems. 
  * As these powerful tools for science, they deviate us from personal bias and magically resolve many difficult research problems
  * I started applying theories to the research to get good publication according to normal high-quality research standards

Soon, I realized the big gap between my research and the daily reality and starting wonder about the meaning and practical senses. I started looking for stronger theories and extending the research problem to bring it to more complicated scenarios but still a tremendous gap compared to the actual systems. But soon, publication race became more important to science rather than discovering the actual causes of things. This is not because we are lazy but it is somehow related to the many unsolvable limitations within the approaches themselves or time/budget limitations as well. 
(I would not describe further, since my limited experience and capability could not represent others).

### Adventure to explore different views of life
But from my inner understanding, I would love to find other ways to see things differently or deeper...
I bought semi-pro and pro cameras and lenses to see how enthusiastic photographers see things and after years I see the beauty in even grass and light. That journey takes me closer to art meaning even I don't exactly know how to explain it. Beauty is sometimes actually nonsense to my logical mindset.
I continue for a while with guitar and learn some experience of melodies. Here I feel the beauty is also in melody, which is also nonsense to my logical mindset. 
It seems I started living with two different views of life sense beauty (maths, equations) as well as nonsense beauty (light, melody)

The best lesson I learned so far is that things can be viewed and experienced by sense as well as nonsense.
Being a little artistic scientist enables me to start viewing things with a more open mindset 

This journey finally comes with a new idea for the philosophy of democratized learning (sense-nonsense reasons). 
I extended my journey to philosophy and looked for analogies from physics, biology, and chemistry patterns to explore what actual system behaviors of distributed AIs.
I learned there we have a complex biological world, complex chemical reactions, and physical laws. Go deeper, anyone could realize many magical, amazing, intelligent,  pathologies, chains, and patterns in nature everywhere. 
And the links are blurred... 
(Again. I would not describe further, since my limited experience and capability could not represent others).

### Another leap coming
It finally led me to whole new areas that nowadays science often leaves behind such as ancient knowledge and philosophy. This leap takes me a long journey to learn and glimpse into how ancients view life.
I wish I would not touch many constroversial things but instead, this let me question more broadly about the nature of existing and life, the nature of things. Surprisingly, How simple and deep they are...

Especially in Eastern philosophies, they don't need equations or experiments to cure people, how they can do that?
How different are they defined and interacted with nature?
How different are the approaches they used?
Most of them are still magically nonsense to nowadays science.!

### Eastern Approach
At first, I hardly saw things in Eastern way according to nowadays Western science. Seems, that a lot of beliefs and unexplained results are available to the public and could be nonsense totally.
But in Eastern approaches, it seems we need great masters to instruct us to understand the deep mechanism behind the scenes (luckily, I found great masters). Seems unseen, unaware mechanisms could affect strongly many seen mechanisms. Since untold philosophies are hidden from the publicity as well for many reasons. 
The Eastern approaches seem to accept heuristic approaches based on confidential experience leading to practical results rather than proving by theoretical equations. 

Eastern approaches ask us to be living deeply based on humanity's ethics, unselfishness, goodness, and wisdom based on causal effects. It reminds us we are a part of wholeness, and thus need to respect nature, ecosystems, harmony living, sharing community, totality, unification, and peace.
(Again. I would not describe further, since my limited experience and capability could not represent others).

### Eastern Science
Last but not least, this final part is the main motivation for this blog.
I am here in the USA, looking at the recent great success of AI. Many big plans and investments for applying AI into normal lives, but also raise a lot of visible/invisible concerns. 
I wonder if Western science is left behind the fast-growing Large AIs towards the big things like AGI (artificial general intelligence). 
Theoretical scientists tried their best but could not catch the big AIs.
Indeed, technologies often come with pros and cons. If we keep the conventional fashions and try to prove and formulate systems after their wide usage, theoretical science seems to be stuck and could be left behind the reality. So, it will be an ineffective responsibility for the emerging powerful technologies such as AI. 
A question came to me: Can we prove, and formulate everything regarding highly dynamic and fast-ever-evolved intelligence as well as climate changes?
If we could not go deeper into the nature/roots of problems itself, we hardly see the overview picture as a whole.

A new approach may emerge from my experience:
- A thing could be seen from many views, and angles but can be understandable when we concentrate more on the root causes not only the top
- We should not look up to the Theoretical Theory (far from practice) and look down to the Practical Confidential Evidence and Experience
- Accept the nonsense to nurture creativity and innovation since we don't know what we don't know due to our limited senses and perspectives
- A lot of problems cannot be proved by math equations but we live with them and adapt to the rapid climate and technological changes 
- After all, we need a Systematic Effective Approach regarding both sense and nonsense toward Ultimate, Practical, Collective Efficiency (E.g.: our balanced body, earth's ecosystem, ultimate social welfare, and global peace)
